# Stock Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices or trends using machine learning models. The dataset is dynamically fetched using the `yfinance` library, which provides historical stock market data. The project will explore various machine learning models, including advanced models like LSTMs, to analyze and predict stock trends.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files (downloaded using `yfinance`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data fetching, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `reports/`: Final report and any related documentation.

## Getting Started
1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Use the `fetch_data.py` script in the `src/` folder to download stock data.
3. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to understand the workflow.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Introduction and Problem Description
The stock market is a complex and dynamic system influenced by numerous factors. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task that requires analyzing historical data and identifying patterns. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict stock prices or trends, providing insights for better decision-making.

## Literature Review
We will review at least three related studies or papers on stock prediction using machine learning. These will be summarized in the final report.

## ML Models, Methods, or Algorithms
The project will explore the following models:
- Traditional models: Linear Regression, Random Forest
- Time Series models: ARIMA, Prophet
- Deep Learning models: LSTM, GRU

## Experimentation and Results
The results will include:
- Training loss and accuracy plots
- Comparisons of model performance
- Discussions on overfitting/underfitting and mitigation strategies
- Ablation studies and computational complexity analysis

## Conclusion
The final report will summarize the key contributions and findings of the project, highlighting the effectiveness of the implemented models and methods.
