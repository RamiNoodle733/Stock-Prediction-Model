    "## 1. Introduction and Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock market prediction is a challenging task that involves forecasting future stock prices based on historical data. This project aims to implement and compare different machine learning models for predicting stock prices, particularly focusing on Apple (AAPL) stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be formally stated as: Given a sequence of historical stock prices, predict the stock price for the next trading day. This is framed as a time-series regression problem where we use N previous days' prices to predict the price on day N+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock market prediction is challenging due to several factors:\n",
    "1. High volatility and noise in stock prices\n",
    "2. Influence of external factors such as market sentiment, news events, etc.\n",
    "3. The efficient market hypothesis, which suggests that stock prices already reflect all available information\n",
    "4. Non-stationarity of financial time series data\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these challenges, machine learning models can potentially identify patterns in historical price movements that may help predict future prices with some level of accuracy."
